                </ul><br>
                <h4>9. INFORMATION ON THE REQUIREMENT OR VOLUNTARY NATURE OF DATA PROVISION AND THE CONSEQUENCES, IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h4>
                <p>To conclude any contract with you and provide any service you need to provide us with the following data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the full company name under which you run your business activity (pursuant to the entry in CEIDG - the Central Registration and
                        Information on Economic Activity);</li>
                    <li>the exact address of the principal place of business (pursuant to the entry in CEIDG);</li>
                    <li>exact delivery address (pursuant to the entry in CEIDG);</li>
                    <li>Tax Identification Number [NIP], Statistical Identification Number [REGON];</li>
                    <li>e-mail address (for communications);</li>
                    <li>delivery addresses;</li>
                    <li>phone number(s) (for contact);</li>
                    <li>possibly the data (first names, surnames, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc.) of contact persons at your company;</li>
                    <li>other data needed or useful for service provision;</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p>The provision of personal data may, in some cases, be laid down in legal provisions and we can expect you to provide such data (e.g., for
                    tax purposes), and failure to provide such data may have the consequences provided for therein. In other cases, the provision of the data
                    will be a contractual requirement or a prerequisite for service provision and then the provision of the data is voluntary. If we are not
                    able to process such data for any reason, we unfortunately cannot conclude a contract effectively and, in consequence, are not in position
                    to provide any services to you or else the provision of such services may be limited considerably.</p><br>
                <h4>10. AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING, PROFILING</h4>
                <p>Your personal data will not be processed automatically and will not be profiled.</p>
